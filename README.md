# WGUProject
The purpose of this project was to create a kotlin android app using https://pokeapi.co/ api.

Requirements
- Main screen should display all of the available pokemon
- When a pokemon is clicked the user should then be taken to all of the pokemon's abilities
- Retrofit and GSON must be used
- Should follow a structured android project layout

Ui design was not considered so therefore I basic CardView's were used
